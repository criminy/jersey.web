		Do a jxpath lookup on the extra component 'header' for the attribute 'name'.
		These components specified are, by default, attached to the 
		JAX-RS resource using annotations. The main resource
		is responsible for all the primary content while the
		components are responsible for additional/presentational 
		information. Components can be looked up different ways
		by prefixing them with a specifier.For example,
			<ux:simple ux:component="props:classpath:path.to.filename.properties" name="some.property"/>
		loads a property file from the classpath and looks up the property called 'some.property' on it.
		We can also look at system properties or property objects in some application-provided context:
			<ux:simple ux:component="props:system:path.to.filename.properties" name="some.property"/>
			<ux:simple ux:component="props:context:some-property-object" name="some.property"/>

	<jx:path path="name" ux:component="header"/>

		Again, we lookup the same attribute on header.
	</ux:comment>
	<h1><jx:path path="name" ux:component="header"/></h1>

	
	<ux:comment>
		We lookup the path 'message' on the default component, which is the
		entity we've been given from the Jersey/JAX-RS call.
	</ux:comment>
	<p>Message: <jx:path path="message"/> </p>

		We can set an attribute by using the ux:atribute tag, and using
		an arbitrary value inside of it to add to the parent tag.
	</ux:comment>
	<a>
		<ux:attribute name="href">
			<jx:path path="link"/>
		</ux:attribute>
		Link Content
	</a>

		We can do it a shorter way using ux:attribute on the tag. ux:attribute is a core
		tag that tells any element: if you give me a String, apply that string to the parent element.
	</ux:comment>
	<a>
		<jx:path path="link" ux:attribute="href"/>
		Link Content
	</a>

		We can also use the uxh namespace to mark a simple html
		element as having additional logic attached to it. However,
		it may turn out to be much slower than other methods.

		In this example, we add the logic of jx:path to this a link. Any 
		attribute using a registered namespace will be passed to jx:path, so
		jx:path gets the 'link' attribute and the 'ux:attribute' attribute.

		One way to not make this slow, I imagine, would be to apply a compile-time
		or startup-time translation of the HTML tree from what we see below
		to what we see above. This can be done by the same rules that parse
		and execute these complex elements. A lot of that may depend
		on whether the html parsing objects provided by jericho are thread-safe.

		The bottom element is one we would like to only process once, as it requires a
		full tree traversal to find attributes.

		Worst case scenerio: implement something akin to JSP (yikes) that turns these into fast(er) calls.
